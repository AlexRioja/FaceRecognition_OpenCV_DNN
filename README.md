# FaceRecognition with DeepNeuralNetworks and OpenCV
This is a Face Recognition system using Deep Neural Networks with the help of OpenCV
It's a complete system itself as it lets you create the dataset, train the dnn with it and then perform the recognition in a live stream capture video.

It's pretty reliable and can be used as a security tool

### Considerations

TESTED on UBUNTU 19.04

You may have to change some path parameters on Windows Systems!

## USAGE :

Execute the operations in this order:
```
create_datasets.py -l <dataset_name> 
```
this will create the dataset in resources/faces_2_recognize. Then execute:

```
extract_embed_features.py
```
that will extract the main features from the dataset and prepare them to be the trainnig data for the algorithm.
Then execute :
```
train_model.py
```
(YOU WILL NEED AT LEAST 2 DATASETS IN faces_2_recognize FOLDER IN ORDER FOR THIS TO WORK!).
And then enjoy executing:

```
recognize_video.py 
```
## How does it work? :

With the dataset features extracted, a Deep Neural Network is trained (SVC (Support Vector Classification) from scikit, that is a type of SVM (Support Vector Machine), a supervised learning method used for classification, in this case image classification) with the extracted features and then...voil√†!.
We can pass images to the DNN and it will tell us the prediction of where does the DNN put this image (in what classification).

## TO-DOs

* Implement algorithm to align faces (the prediction works better if the face is correctly aligned)
* Create Script that works as a Trigger for others retrieving face identification
